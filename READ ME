This is pretty much my first coding project created close to 5 years ago now. Of course when I first started programming I wanted to make a video game and this is
what I ended up making. The images and music used are not here since the ones I orginally used were not mine.
A very simple game were fish drop from the top of the screen and you have to catch then with your character. Features kept getting added to the
game as time went on (usally sugestions from my friends in high school). New charcters you could play, music options, a full ui that was made using pygame zero. 
This zersion uploaded here is has about 3/4 of what ended up being the final version. I unfortantly lost the final version, due to not backing it up and wiping my old 
computer. This is by no means a well coded game and there are a ton of issues I never fixed. But it really is what helped get me more interested in coding and has a 
fond place in my memories. I thought I might as well upload what I have left of it here as a keepsake. Thanks Mr Homes.
